# JS Learning

This repository is my personal space for **learning, practicing, and documenting progress** in JavaScript and related technologies.

## 📌 What’s inside

- **JavaScript basics** → practice scripts for core concepts (arrays, promises, async/await, closures, etc.)
- Other tools, frameworks, or ideas I explore along the way

## 🎯 Purpose

- Keep track of my learning journey in one place
- Write small, focused programs or mini-projects as I study
- Have a reference library I can come back to later

## 🚀 How I use this repo

Each folder is organized by technology (e.g., `javascript/`, `node/`, `express/`). Inside, I add scripts or mini-projects related to that topic. Over time, this repo will grow as I learn more.

This is not a polished “production” repo — it’s a **living notebook** of code and experiments.
